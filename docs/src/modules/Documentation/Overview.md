# Security Documentation

Security documentation is generated by the GKE cluster on deployment. This includes information about the GKE cluster as well as general security guidance. Optionally, internal documentation can also be found at `internal-docs.[YOUR-DOMAIN]`.

## Quickstart

1. Select the modules you want in your cluster. Modules refer to services such as SDARQ, CodeDx, etc.

2. (Optional) Create a Docker image that runs a static site with documentation unique to your AppSec program. For examples, see [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/docs) or [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/). Push this docker image to the Google Container Registry in the Google Cloud Project where your cluster is located, under the tag `internal-documentation`. You should be able to pull the image from `docker pull gcr.io/[YOUR-GCP-PROJECT]/internal-documentation`.

3. Our cluster will automatically deploy your documentation.
