A tool built by the Application Security Team at the DSP, Broad Institute.

Sdarq is a coordination platform to guide both developers and AppSec professionals through an SDLC and provide interfaces into various tools and bind them.

SDARQ was built to integrate security requirements throughout different phases in the Software Development Lifecycle. Product teams develop new services and features all the time. Retrofitting security is a very costly exercise both from a technical standpoint as well as from a security perspective.

It allows product teams to be aware of all security-related and compliance-related requirements as early as possible, ideally before they have even written a single line of code and for better visibility and eventually better mitigation for any potential vulnerabilities that may exist in any service. By serving as a bridge on the partnership between the Appsec team and Product teams, SDARQ helps engineers develop secure services as part of Terra by generating actionable and specific security requirements based on the technical characteristics of the service being built.

SDARQ orchestrates different security tools and scanners owned by the DSP Appsec team. These tools include DefectDojo, CodeDx, CIS Scanner, ZAP Scanner.
