# Git Commit Signing

Repository Integrity with signed commits

## Background

Signing git commits because it helps ensure repository integrity. When someone has write access to a repository it is very easy to spoof commits pretending to be someone else. However, there is also an external attack vector for those projects that accept PRs from outside collaborators. 

## Example

Git commits can be spoofed.

**Scenario 1 - legit commit**

**Scenario 2 - spoofed commit from a user who has access to the repo** ![Spoofed commit from user with access](/img/fake-commit.png)

**Scenario 3 - spoofed commit via PR as an outside collaborator**

## Steps to follow to set up commit signing are located below.

Alternatively, you can just run the following [script](https://github.com/broadinstitute/dsp-security-knowledgebase/blob/master/source/scripts/gitsign.sh). Please ensure you have [installed gpg](https://gpgtools.org/), prior to running the script.

* Generate a GPG key:

* Add the GPG key to your Github account:

  [https://help.github.com/en/articles/adding-a-new-gpg-key-to-your-github-account](https://help.github.com/en/articles/adding-a-new-gpg-key-to-your-github-account)

* Start signing commits:

**\(Recommended)** Set up Automatic Signing To remove the hassle of always remembering to sign your commits, you can configure Git to sign all your commits automatically as you create them.

```text
git config â€“-global commit.gpgsign true
```
