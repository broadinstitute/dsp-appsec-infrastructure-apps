        <br>
        <p class="animated fadeIn finite">A tool built by the Application Security Team at the DSP, Broad Institute. </p>

        <p class="animated fadeIn finite">SDARQ was built to integrate security requirements throughout different phases
          in the SDLC. Product teams develop new services and features all the time. Retrofitting security is a very
          costly exercise both from a technical standpoint as well as from a security perspective. </p>
        <p class="animated fadeIn finite"> It allows product teams to be aware of all security-related and
          compliance-related requirements as early as possible, ideally before they have even written a single line of
          code. By serving as a bridge on the partnership between the Appsec team and Product teams, SDARQ helps DSP
          develop secure services as part of Terra by generating actionable and specific security requirements based on
          the technical characteristics of the service being built.
        </p>
        <p class="animated fadeIn finite">SDARQ is composed of several modules that perform application security scans
          and CIS benchmark scans. This allows for better visibility and eventually better mitigation for any potential
          vulnerabilities that may exist in Terra services. Additionally the CIS benchmark scans allow us to apply
          defense in depth and hardening which help us protect data and assets in the cloud. </p>
