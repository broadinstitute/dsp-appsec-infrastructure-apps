        <h5>Threat modeling is an approach for analyzing the security of an application. It is a structured approach
          that enables you to identify, quantify, and address the security risks associated with an application.
        </h5> <br><br>

        <h5>What? </h5>
        <p>
          <li>A repeatable process to find and address all threats to your product </li>
        </p>
        <br>
        <h5>Why? </h5>
        <p>
          <li>Because attackers think differently</li>
          <li>Find problems when there’s time to fix them </li>
          <li>Security Development Lifecycle (SDL) requirement </li>
          <li>Deliver more secure products</li>
        </p>
        <br>
        <h5>When? </h5>
        <p>
          <li>The earlier you start, the more time to plan and fix </li>
          <li>Worst case is for when you’re trying to ship: Find problems, make ugly scope and schedule choices, revisit
            those features soon</li>
        </p>
