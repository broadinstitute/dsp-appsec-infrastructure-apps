The majority of the value in this exercise should come from the fact that a general idea about the impact that a particular change may have in the Prod environment allows Product Teams to have a meaningful discussion with the Appsec team in order to determine if there is anything inherently wrong from a security perspective before moving on with the actual implementation. \n\n<hr>\n<hr>\n<h4>Prerequisites</h4>\nPlease make sure you are familiar with <a href='https://owasp.org/www-pdf-archive/OWASP_Top_10-2017_%28en%29.pdf.pdf'>OWASP Top 10.</a>This will be an important reference during the risk assessment process\n<hr>\n\n\n\n"
