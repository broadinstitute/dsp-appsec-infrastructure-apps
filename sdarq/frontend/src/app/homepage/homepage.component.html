      Review this checklist so you know what to expect for deployment. <br>
      Decide (then confirm with Infosec) whether you need to write an SIA. If needed: <br>
      <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok" aria-hidden="true"></span> Write it <br>
      <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok" aria-hidden="true"></span> Get it reviewed internally <br>
      <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok" aria-hidden="true"></span> Get it reviewed by the government <br>
      Talk to QA. Make sure you have a plan in place to have this tested by the due date. <br>
      Talk to DevOps. Make sure you let them know of the due date. Confirm that they will be able to offer the resources you think you may need. This may be a negotiation.<br>
      If timelines seem tight, escalate.

      If you arenâ€™t already completely done with the checklist and relaxing on a hammock with a martini in one hand you must escalate immediately.
