For example, they can be used to confirm that authentication is required to access user data; or that unexpected HTML tags can't get through input filters or escaping routines. \n\nIntegration testing: Testing performed to expose defects in the interfaces and in the interactions between integrated components or systems.\n\nPerformance/Monitoring testing: Once the application is deployed, the focus usually shifts from testing to monitoring. Watch out for unexpected spikes in error rates, sandbox violations, and other flaky or inexplicable behavior (including intermittent test failures) — and before you dismiss an anomaly, check with your security team. Crashes and flakiness can indicate a race condition or a memory corruption bug (if applicable)."
