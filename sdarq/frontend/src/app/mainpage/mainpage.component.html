    <h5>Introducing a New Service?</h5>
    <p>
      Youâ€™re launching a new service, congratulations!
      Great,
      let's make sure you're aware of security-related considerations related to your service. A new service is defined
      as
      a new component that is deployed into a production environment. It may be deployed onto newly provisioned
      infrastructure
      such as a GCE instance, or into a serverless framework such as a cloud function. Something where a team is
      instantiating
      a new host structure or Google service for the first time. For example, a new service could be a:

    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/containers/deploying-containers">Docker container running on a
          new GCE node</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/quickstart">Docker container deployed to a GKE/K8S
          Cluster</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/">Google App Engine app</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://cloud.google.com/functions/">Google Cloud Function</a></li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h5>How do I get started?</h5>
    <p>
      The set of questions below will be used to gain a better understanding of your architecture, tech stack and
      security posture,
      and provide security-related advice and action items. This will enable AppSec and DevOps teams to be involved
      as early as
      possible in the SDLC. We want to make sure that all new services have common understanding of security
      considerations.
