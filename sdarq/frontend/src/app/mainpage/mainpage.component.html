  <h5>Introducing a New Service?</h5>
  <p>
    Youâ€™re launching a new service as a part of the Analysis Platforms (Terra, FireCloud, AoU), congratulations! Great,
    let's make sure you're aware of security-related considerations related to your service. A new service is defined as
    a new component that is deployed into a production environment. It may be deployed onto newly provisioned infrastructure
    such as a GCE instance, or into a serverless framework such as a cloud function. Something where a team is instantiating
    a new host structure or Google service for the first time For example, a new service could be a:

  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/containers/deploying-containers">Docker container running on a new GCE node</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/quickstart">Docker container deployed to a GKE/K8S Cluster</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/">Google App Engine app</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://cloud.google.com/functions/">Google Cloud Function</a></li>
  </ul>
  <br> 
  <h5>How do I get started?</h5>
  <p>
    The set of questions below will be used to gain a better understanding of your architecture, tech stack and security posture,
    and provide security-related advice and action items. This will enable DSP AppSec and DevOps teams to be involved as early as
    possible in the SDLC. We want to make sure that all new services have common understanding of security considerations.
